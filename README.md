## 🖼 Adding Photos

### Option 1: Store Images in the Repository (Recommended)

1. Create an `images/` folder in the project root.
2. Upload your photos to the folder.
3. Reference them inside the configuration.

Example:

```javascript
img: "images/photo1.jpg"
```

---

### Option 2: Use External Image URLs

Upload images to a hosting service such as Imgur or Google Drive and use the direct image URL.

Example:

```javascript
img: "https://i.imgur.com/example.jpg"
```

## 📌 Where Images Are Used

| Configuration Key       | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `pinSlides[i].img`      | Main Apple-style storytelling sections         |
| `memories[i].img`       | Memory gallery and photo wall                  |
| HTML image placeholders | Additional reveal sections throughout the page |

For custom reveal sections, replace the existing placeholder elements with:

```html
<img src="your-image-url.jpg" alt="Memory">
```

## 🎨 Customizing Colors

The website uses CSS variables for easy theme customization. Edit the values inside the `:root` selector:

```css
--pink-deep:  #c9517a;
--pink-main:  #e8789a;
--pink-soft:  #f4a7be;
--pink-blush: #fce4ec;
```

Feel free to replace these colors with any palette that matches your preferred style.
